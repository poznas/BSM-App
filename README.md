# Bulgarian School of Magic
I have organized a summer camp, where people split into three teams were
competing with each other. They performed different tasks, which needed to
be judged in a fair way. Solving this problem was my first big programming
adventure with Android and Firebase. I have developed a system, where
users in Bulgaria send proofs of completing task to judges in Poland. Then
they assign score, which adds up to the total scoreboard.

This is my first own initiative project and at the same time it is the bigest Android app I have made so far _( over 10 000 lines of .java code )_. Written last summer right after completing _"Android Basics Nanodegree Program"_ on _Udacity_. This summer I am going to rewrite it from scratch to improve code quality and add new functionalities.
