# Bulgarian School of Magic
I have organized a summer camp, where people split into three teams were
competing with each other. They performed different tasks, which needed to
be judged in a fair way. Solving this problem was my first big programming
adventure with Android and Firebase. I have developed a system, where
users in Bulgaria send proofs of completing task to judges in Poland. Then
they assign score, which adds up to the total scoreboard.
